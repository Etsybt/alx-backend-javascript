# NodeJS Basics

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts to anyone, without the help of Google:

- **Run JavaScript using Node.js**: Understand how to execute JavaScript code outside of a browser using Node.js.
  
- **Use Node.js modules**: Learn how to import and utilize built-in and external Node.js modules to enhance your application's functionality.

- **Use specific Node.js modules to read files**: Gain the ability to read and manipulate files using modules like `fs`.

- **Use `process` to access command line arguments and the environment**: Leverage Node.js's `process` object to work with command line arguments and environment variables, enabling more dynamic applications.

- **Create a small HTTP server using Node.js**: Learn how to set up a basic HTTP server using Node.js's built-in `http` module to handle requests and responses.

- **Create a small HTTP server using Express.js**: Use Express.js, a popular Node.js framework, to build a more efficient and powerful HTTP server with simplified routing and middleware support.

- **Create advanced routes with Express.js**: Develop complex routes with Express.js to handle various HTTP methods, dynamic URLs, and route parameters.

- **Use ES6 with Node.js using Babel-node**: Write modern JavaScript code using ES6 features and transpile it using Babel to maintain compatibility with Node.js environments.

- **Use Nodemon to develop faster**: Implement Nodemon to automatically restart your Node.js application whenever file changes are detected, speeding up the development process.
